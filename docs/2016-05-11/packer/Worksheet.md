Docker / Packer exercises
-------------------------
### Template file
* Have a look at the [packer template](https://github.com/rvosa/arangs2016/blob/master/conf/vagrant/template.json) file.
* What will be the name of our Vagrant box if we execute this file using packer?
* Which provisioning tools are specified? 
* What does the "shell" provisioner install and why?
* Where does the "puppet" provisioner get its instructions from?
* In what order would the provisioners have to be executed?
* How many different virtualization environments are we building for?
* What OS are we using?
