					<h2>Course Description</h2>
					<h3>Introduction</h3>
					Next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies for DNA have resulted in a yet
					bigger deluge of data. Researchers are learning that analyzing the data efficiently
					requires the creation of sophisticated pipelines, typically using commandline
					tools in a Linux or other Opensource Unix variant compute environment.  Many researchers
					have created these pipelines to successfully analyze their data.  Now they are faced
					with the challenge of making these pipelines available to their colleagues.  The issue
					of reproducibility has emerged as <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/focus/reproducibility/">a major challenge</a>, as researchers, peer 
					reviewers, and companies in the life sciences discover that the software and data used 
					to produce a particular research finding are either not available, poorly documented, or 
					targeted to specific compute infrastructures that are not available to the wider research 
					community. To remedy this, funding agencies and journals are creating policies to promote 
					software reproducibility. In this brief workshop we will establish several <b>best 
					practices</b> of reproducibility in the analysis of data obtained by NGS. In doing so we 
					will encounter the commonly used <b>technologies</b> that enable these best practices by 
					working through <b>use cases</b> that illustrate the underlying principles. Building on the 
					basis of an existing pipeline of commandline utilities, we will illustrate how the entire 
					compute environment used to run the pipeline can be packaged into a unit that can be shared 
					with other researchers such that they can make full use of the environment on their own 
					machines, or on standard cloud compute environments such as amazon or rackspace.

					<h3>Best practices</h3>
					<ul>
						<!-- for example: bwa mapping and variant calling, de novo assembly, metagenomics -->
						<li>Commandline scripting of analysis steps</li>
						
						<!-- puppet/chef, docker -->
						<li>Provisioning systems to standardize software environment requirements</li>
						
						<!-- vagrant, disk images -->
						<li>Packaging of compute environment into static, portable units</li>
						
						<!-- vagrantboxes, docker hub -->
						<li>Sharing of compute environment packages</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Technologies</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Next generation sequencing platforms</li>
						<li>Command-line executables, command line scripting and batching</li>
						<li>Provisioning Systems: Puppet, Dockerfile</li>
						<li>Virtualization with Virtualbox and Vagrant</li>
						<li>Containerization with Docker</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>Target audience</h2>
					This course is aimed at researchers who've developed pipelines to analyze NGS
					data and now, faced with new reproducibility requirements, would like to learn
					how to package their analysis pipeline into in a reproducible (and shareable)
					way. This course will start with a very basic NGS pipeline that runs in a
					Linux commandline environment, and develop this pipeline into two packages that
					can be shared with, and used by other researchers. The ideal attendee is a scientist
					who is already comfortable developing scripted pipelines on the commandline, or who is
					not afraid to get his/her hands dirty to acquire the computer-literacy skills
					for dealing with the informatics side of data analysis.
					<h2>Pre-requisites</h2>
					The course assumes that attendees are not intimidated by the prospect of gaining
					experience working on UNIX-like operating systems (including the shell, and shell
					scripting).
					Attendees should understand some of the science behind high-throughput DNA sequencing
					and sequence analysis, as we will not go deeply into underlying theory (or the
					mechanics of given algorithms, for example) as such. What will be taught are
					technical solutions for automating and sharing such analyses in shareable, reusable compute
					environments, which will include (but is not limited to) beginner-level programming, and
					basic Linux provisioning. General computer literacy, (e.g. editing plain text data files, navigating
					the command line) will be assumed.
