docker-compose
--------------

- Have a look at [this yml file](https://github.com/rvosa/arangs2016/blob/master/docker-compose.yml)
- How many build contexts are there?
- Where are the build contexts relative to the YAML file?
- Why does line 4 start with a hyphen? What does this mean in YAML syntax (look it up)? What does this imply about volumes?
