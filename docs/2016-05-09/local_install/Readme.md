=============

Now we are going to struggle with a profound issue that is affecting research. Researchers face this issue everytime they attempt to reproduce, or reuse another researchers computational tools.  We are going to try to reproduce the computational environment for the class pipeline on the class machines.

All of you have the ability to run commands as 'root' on your participant machines, using the sudo command.

```bash
$ sudo id -u
```

You should be able to compile the bwa and samtools packages that we need for the course.  You should also be able to download the data into the data directories.
